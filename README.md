# Resort-Booking-App
A new android application for making resort booking easy. In the traditional booking method, users ought to search for various resorts on the web and then book them on their particular website.

Search queries for resorts and hotels in the U.S. are at their highest levels in nearly 10 years, according to Google data. The ulterior motive of this android
application is to rack up various beautiful resorts at one place with an easy booking option
available. This will help the users to find beautiful resorts effortlessly, without prolonged
searching on the web. Using this system users can view and check for various resorts available
along with its images and salient features and simultaneously book them. The user may call the
owner using the inbuilt call button or visit the website using the visit button to confirm their
booking. Our application also provides a Gmap button to locate the resort over google maps. To
make our application user friendly we added an option to save the desired resorts and view them
separately. Users may also get recommendations of various other resorts based on the earlier
search and booking results. This android application is capable of helping its users to plan a
marvelous vacation with one tap. The ease of booking and user friendly interface makes our
resort booking application an impressive one.
